    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>Dating in the digital world is hard. Where are the standards? There are none! Almost anyone and everyone can make an account on dating sites such as OkCupid, Bumble, and Tinder as seen from personal experience of making fake accounts as an underaged minor. 
The dating sites that exist for the elite often discriminate against and do not cater to black people, and especially black people of a high socioeconomic status. The sites that cater to black people like BlackPeopleMeet.Com allow anyone to join. This does not allow those that want to establish relationships to connect with people of a similar stature within the black community to do so. Finally, there is a site for upper class black professionals to meet a partner that fits all their standards! We take the time to scout out your perfect match so you can focus on your career. We will never waste your time with someone who does not meet all of your standards. With this new approach, black professionals can be with who they truly want to be with and will not have to settle on someone that comes close or not at all. </p>

Where are the standards? There are none! Almost anyone and everyone can make an account on dating sites such as OkCupid, Bumble, and Tinder as seen from personal experience of making fake accounts as an under aged minor.

	<h2>Tips for Meeting Offline!</h2>
	<p>The day has come! Excitement for first meetings are unmatched and more times than not, are perfectly safe. However, the team at Talented 10th Meet want to ensure that our members are always taking precautions. Here are a few guidelines we suggest: Always meet in public in populus locations. Tell a pal or anyone close to you who, what, when, and where in regards to your first meeting! Always keep your mobile device on you. Stay calm and keep sober -- for ensuring your own safety and clarity of decision making keep the drinks light and fun! Lastly, drive yourself to and from the the first meeting in case things donâ€™t work out!</p>
